# stb-905x-indonesia
Adding support to Custom ROM based on your own compilation AOSP or extended AOSP

This project dedicated to make the Indonesian product of AMLOGIC 905x based STB to be an open source ROM. You can modify your own source code make your own automation or anything ...

Supported device :

- STB HG680p (2G Ram) also known in Indonesia as Fiberhome with chipset S905X and board known as P212_GLX (based on ARMBIAN information)


Weird thing is why no one compile the AOSP in latest version like Android 7.0, Android 8.1, Android 9, 10 or 11 .. ?
there is already ARMBIAN with ubuntu 20.x version already. So what is something that everybody missing ? The most rom is customized Android 6.0.1, not compiled from scratch.
